# FocusTrap

The `FocusTrap` component in React Refocus ensures that keyboard navigation remains within a specific container. This component is particularly useful in scenarios such as modals, dialogs, or any other element where you want to trap focus, enhancing accessibility and ensuring smooth user experience.

## Syntax

```jsx
<FocusTrap className={string}>
  {children}
</FocusTrap>
```

### Props

- **`children`** (ReactNode): The content to be rendered inside the `FocusTrap` component.
- **`className`** (string, optional): Additional class names to apply to the `FocusTrap` container.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { FocusTrap } from 'react-refocus';

const Modal = () => (
    <FocusTrap>
        <div role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
            <h2>Modal Title</h2>
            <p>This is a modal window. Press Tab to cycle through elements.</p>
            <button>Close</button>
        </div>
    </FocusTrap>
);

export default Modal;
```

## Usage

The `FocusTrap` component is used to keep the keyboard focus within a specific container, preventing users from accidentally tabbing out of a modal, dialog, or other controlled UI components. This ensures that all keyboard interactions are confined within the intended area, improving both usability and accessibility.

> ### Accessibility Note
> Trapping focus within a container is essential in ensuring that users who rely on keyboard navigation can interact with all elements within a dialog or modal without losing focus to other parts of the page. Proper focus management is critical for providing an accessible user experience.
