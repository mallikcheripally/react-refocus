# FocusContext

The `FocusContext` in React Refocus provides a context for managing and tracking focus within your application. It enables components to programmatically control which elements are focused, improving accessibility and user experience, especially for keyboard navigation.

## Syntax

```jsx
<FocusProvider>
  {children}
</FocusProvider>
```

### Props

- **`children`** (ReactNode): The child components that need access to the focus context.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { FocusProvider } from 'react-refocus';

const App = () => (
  <FocusProvider>
    <YourComponent />
  </FocusProvider>
);

export default App;
```

# useFocusContext

The `useFocusContext` hook provides access to the focus context. It returns the current context value for focus management, including functions to update the focused element and set focus on a specific element.

## Syntax

```jsx
const { focusedElement, setFocusedElement, focusElement } = useFocusContext();
```

### Returns

- **`focusedElement`** (HTMLElement | null): The current element that is focused.
- **`setFocusedElement`** (function): A function to update the focused element.
- **`focusElement`** (function): A function to set focus on a specified element and update the

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFocusContext } from 'react-refocus';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { focusedElement, focusElement } = useFocusContext();

  const handleFocus = () => {
    const buttonElement = document.getElementById('button1');
    if (buttonElement) {
      focusElement(buttonElement);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Button 1</button>
      <p>Currently focused element: {focusedElement?.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default YourComponent;
```

## Usage

The `FocusContext` is useful in scenarios where you need to manage focus across multiple components in a React application. It can be particularly helpful in complex UI structures where keyboard accessibility is critical.

> ### Accessibility Note
> Proper focus management is crucial for accessibility. By using `FocusContext`, you can ensure that focus is handled correctly, especially when dynamically updating content or when certain elements need to receive focus based on user actions.
