# useFocusOnMount

The `useFocusOnMount` hook in React Refocus automatically sets focus on a referenced element when the component mounts. This hook is particularly useful for improving accessibility and user experience by ensuring that the correct element receives focus immediately upon rendering.

## Syntax

```jsx
useFocusOnMount(shouldFocus?: boolean): React.MutableRefObject<HTMLElement>;
```

### Props

- **`shouldFocus`** (boolean, optional): A boolean value indicating whether the element should receive focus upon mount. Defaults to `true`.

### Returns

- **`elementRef`** (React.MutableRefObject&lt;HTMLElement&gt;): A mutable ref object that you attach to the element that should receive focus.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFocusOnMount } from 'react-refocus/hooks/useFocusOnMount';

const InputComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = useFocusOnMount<HTMLInputElement>();

  return (
    <input
      ref={inputRef}
      type="text"
      placeholder="This input will be focused on mount"
    />
  );
};

export default InputComponent;
```

## Usage

The `useFocusOnMount` hook is commonly used in forms, modals, and other UI components where you want to direct the user's attention to a specific input or button when the component first renders. By automatically setting focus, you can streamline interactions and improve the overall user experience.

> ### Accessibility Note
> Ensuring that the correct element is focused on mount is crucial for accessibility, particularly for users who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers. The `useFocusOnMount` hook helps maintain a logical flow of interaction, making your application more inclusive.
