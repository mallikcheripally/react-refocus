# useHomeEndKeyNavigation

The `useHomeEndKeyNavigation` hook in React Refocus allows you to enable Home and End key navigation within a specified container. This hook is designed to improve keyboard navigation by allowing users to jump to the first or last focusable element within the container using the Home or End keys, respectively.

## Syntax

```jsx
useHomeEndKeyNavigation(
    containerRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
    customSelectors: string[] = []
): void;
```

### Props

- **`containerRef`** (React.RefObject&lt;HTMLElement&gt;): The reference to the container element where the Home and End key navigation should be applied.
- **`customSelectors`** (string[], optional): Additional selectors for custom focusable elements within the container. By default, the hook targets common focusable elements such as links, buttons, inputs, and textareas.

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import useHomeEndKeyNavigation from 'react-refocus/hooks/useHomeEndKeyNavigation';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useHomeEndKeyNavigation(containerRef);

  return (
    <div ref={containerRef} className="navigation-container">
      <button>Button 1</button>
      <button>Button 2</button>
      <button>Button 3</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

## Usage

The `useHomeEndKeyNavigation` hook is particularly useful for complex UIs with multiple focusable elements, such as forms, modal dialogs, or custom navigation components. By enabling Home and End key navigation, you can significantly enhance the keyboard navigation experience for users, making your application more accessible and user-friendly.

> ### Accessibility Note
> Enabling Home and End key navigation helps improve the usability of your application for users who rely on keyboard navigation. This feature ensures that users can quickly navigate to the beginning or end of a focusable content area, providing a more intuitive and accessible experience.
