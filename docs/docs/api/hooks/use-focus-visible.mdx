# useFocusVisible

The `useFocusVisible` hook in React Refocus helps manage focus visibility by distinguishing between keyboard and mouse interactions. This is particularly useful in enhancing accessibility and improving the user experience by ensuring that focus indicators are only shown when navigating via the keyboard.

## Syntax

```jsx
useFocusVisible(): boolean;
```

### Returns

- (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the focus is visible due to keyboard interaction.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFocusVisible } from 'react-refocus/hooks/useFocusVisible';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const isFocusVisible = useFocusVisible();

  return (
    <button
      style={{
        outline: isFocusVisible ? '2px solid #1E90FF' : 'none',
      }}
    >
      Focus Me
    </button>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

## Usage

The `useFocusVisible` hook is ideal for scenarios where you want to provide a focus indicator that only appears when the user is navigating the interface using a keyboard. This helps to avoid unnecessary focus outlines for mouse interactions, maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

> ### Accessibility Note
> This hook enhances accessibility by ensuring that focus indicators are shown only when needed, reducing visual noise for mouse users while providing essential feedback for keyboard users. Proper focus management is crucial for creating inclusive web applications.
