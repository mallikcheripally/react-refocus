# useFocusWithin

The `useFocusWithin` hook in React Refocus manages focus within a specified container, helping you to detect when any child element within the container gains or loses focus. This can be particularly useful for implementing advanced focus management behaviors in complex user interfaces, enhancing both accessibility and user experience.

## Syntax

```jsx
useFocusWithin(): (element: HTMLElement | null) => void;
```

### Props

- **`element`** (HTMLElement | null): The container element to monitor for focus changes. If `null` is passed, the event listeners are removed.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFocusWithin } from 'react-refocus/hooks/useFocusWithin';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const setRef = useFocusWithin();

  return (
    <div ref={setRef} className="focus-container">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Input 1" />
      <input type="text" placeholder="Input 2" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

## Usage

The `useFocusWithin` hook is useful for managing and styling elements based on focus state within a container. For example, you might want to highlight a form section when any of its input fields are focused. This hook is especially useful for improving accessibility by making it clear which part of the UI is currently active.

> ### Accessibility Note
> Proper focus management is crucial for accessible web applications. The `useFocusWithin` hook helps maintain clear and consistent focus indicators, ensuring that keyboard users can easily navigate your application.
